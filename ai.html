            The AI Accessibility Generator is a custom JavaScript application
            that I developed over one week for the SheCodes AI Class. The
            project utilizes JavaScript, AI, HTML, and CSS. Unlike other AI
            generators that create fun content such as poems or jokes, this
            project concentrates on generating the Web Content Accessibility
            Guidelines (WCAG). My goal was to provide developers, designers, and
            tech professionals with a more intuitive understanding of these
            standards.
