            <p>
              I started my coding journey at 13 when I stumbled upon HTML and
              CSS while playing a video game called Neopets. Since then, I've
              attended several coding workshops, a UX/UI boot camp, and
              completed a course on accessibility design to cater to a diverse
              audience.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before I got into coding and design, I spent five years as a
              Bioenvironmental Engineer in the US Air Force. This experience
              allowed me to tackle environmental and occupational health
              challenges and gave me insight into various work environments and
              complex systems. I also developed an interest in understanding how
              people perform tasks and the problems they face.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me practicing yoga to
              find calmness, cooking to satisfy my curiosity, or painting to
              express my creativity. I'm always eager to learn and grow, both
              personally and professionally.

            <p>
              Hey there! I'm a coder and designer based in Dayton, and I love
              creating beautiful and accessible designs. It all started for me
              when I was a teenager and discovered my passion for coding. While
              serving in the United States Air Force, I had the opportunity to
              tackle environmental and occupational health challenges. I've also
              participated in women-focused coding workshops, a UX/UI bootcamp,
              and accessibility design courses, which have all helped me grow as
              a coder and designer. When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me
              practicing yoga to find calmness, cooking to satisfy my curiosity,
              or painting to express my creativity. I'm always eager to learn
              and grow, both personally and professionally.
